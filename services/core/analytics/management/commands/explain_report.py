"""Print EXPLAIN ANALYZE plans for the top-sellers query, with and without
its supporting index.

Methodology matters here:
- `VACUUM (ANALYZE)` runs first, so the planner has current statistics and
  the visibility map is populated (index-only scans are impossible without
  it on a freshly bulk-loaded table).
- Each variant is executed twice and the second run is reported, so both
  variants are measured against warm caches rather than whichever ran first
  paying the cold-start cost.
- PostgreSQL DDL is transactional, so the "without index" measurement drops
  the index inside a transaction that is rolled back — the live schema is
  never actually changed and both variants see identical data.

Output is markdown-ready for docs/query-optimization.md.
