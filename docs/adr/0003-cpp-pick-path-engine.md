# ADR 0003: C++ (pybind11) for the pick-path optimiser, with a Python twin

**Status:** accepted

## Context

Turning an order into a picking route is a travelling-salesman variant:
minimise picker travel over the warehouse grid while visiting every bin. We
use nearest-neighbour construction plus 2-opt refinement, which is
quadratic per pass, runs many passes, is pure CPU, and executes on the
request path for every pick list. This is the honest case for native code:
an interpreter-bound inner loop, not I/O.

## Decision

Implement the optimiser twice, deliberately:

- `pickpath`: the pure-Python reference implementation and the behavioural
  specification. Runs anywhere, including a laptop with no compiler.
- `pickpath-native`: the same algorithm in C++17, bound with pybind11,
  built by scikit-build-core in the Docker builder stage and in CI. The
  binding releases the GIL during optimisation so a busy web worker keeps
  serving other requests.

Both are deterministic with identical tie-breaking (lowest index on equal
distance; first-improvement 2-opt that restarts its scan after each applied
swap). `pickpath.optimize_route()` selects the native engine when it is
importable and falls back to Python otherwise.

## Consequences

- **Testability:** parity tests assert exact sequence equality between
  engines across 150 randomised instances, and a Held-Karp exact solver
  provides a true optimum oracle for small instances. "The C++ is correct
  because it is provably the same function" beats "it looks right".
- **An honest speedup story:** the benchmark (`native/bench_pickpath.py`,
  table in the README) measures the interpreter overhead being removed,
  typically one to two orders of magnitude on realistic order sizes.
- Cost: two implementations to keep in sync, mitigated by the parity
  suite, which fails loudly on any behavioural drift.
